# Command X - Branding and Style Guide

This document outlines the basic branding elements and style guidelines for the Command X construction management system.

## 1. Logo

The official Command X logo is provided in the file `command_x_logo.png`.

*   **Usage:** Use the primary logo whenever possible. Ensure sufficient clear space around the logo.
*   **Variations:** Adaptations for different backgrounds (e.g., monochrome versions) may be developed as needed.
*   **Minimum Size:** Ensure the logo text "Command X" remains legible at smaller sizes.

## 2. Color Palette

The primary color palette draws inspiration from the construction and technology sectors, aiming for a professional and modern feel.

*   **Primary Blue:** `#1E3A8A` (Deep Blue - Used for primary actions, headers, accents)
*   **Secondary Blue:** `#3B82F6` (Lighter Blue - Used for highlights, links)
*   **Accent Orange:** `#F97316` (Used sparingly for calls-to-action, warnings, or key highlights)
*   **Neutral Gray (Dark):** `#1F2937` (Used for text, dark backgrounds)
*   **Neutral Gray (Medium):** `#6B7280` (Used for secondary text, borders)
*   **Neutral Gray (Light):** `#F3F4F6` (Used for backgrounds)
*   **White:** `#FFFFFF`

*(Note: These are initial suggestions based on the logo and common practices. Tailwind CSS defaults provide a good starting point and can be customized further.)*

## 3. Typography

*   **Primary Font:** Inter (or a similar clean, sans-serif font available via Tailwind defaults or Google Fonts). Used for all UI text, headings, and body content.
*   **Hierarchy:** Use font weight (e.g., bold, semibold) and size variations to establish clear visual hierarchy for headings, subheadings, and paragraph text.

## 4. Naming Convention

*   The application MUST be referred to as **"Command X"** in all user interfaces, documentation, code comments, and communications.
*   Avoid abbreviations unless explicitly defined (e.g., "CX" might be used internally or in specific contexts like the logo initials, but the full name is preferred).

## 5. Tone of Voice

*   Professional, clear, concise, and helpful.
*   UI text should be action-oriented and easy to understand.
