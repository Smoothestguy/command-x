# Command X - Construction Management System

This repository contains the initial setup, design documents, and frontend scaffolding for the Command X construction management system, based on the provided requirements.

## Project Overview

Command X is envisioned as a comprehensive, web-based system for managing construction projects, work orders, subcontractors, financials, quality control, and reporting, with mobile accessibility.

## Current Status

This initial phase focused on establishing the foundational architecture and structure:

1.  **Database Schema:** A detailed PostgreSQL schema (`command_x_db_schema.sql`) has been designed, incorporating core entities (Projects, Work Orders, Users, etc.) and considerations for TimescaleDB.
2.  **Backend Architecture:** A microservices-based architecture using Node.js, Express, Kafka, and Redis has been outlined (`command_x_backend_architecture.md`). Key services (User Management, Project Management, etc.) are defined.
3.  **Frontend Scaffolding:** A React application (`command-x-frontend/`) has been initialized using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and includes necessary libraries (Redux Toolkit, React Query, React Router). Basic layout, routing, and placeholder pages for all major sections have been created.
4.  **Branding:** An initial logo (`command_x_logo.png`) and style guide (`command_x_style_guide.md`) have been created, establishing the visual identity for Command X.

## Deliverables Included

*   `command_x_db_schema.sql`: PostgreSQL database schema definition.
*   `command_x_backend_architecture.md`: Design document for the backend microservices architecture.
*   `command_x_frontend.zip`: Archive containing the scaffolded React frontend application.
*   `command_x_logo.png`: The generated logo for Command X.
*   `command_x_style_guide.md`: Basic branding and style guidelines.
*   `README.md`: This file.

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

Building the complete Command X system requires significant further development, including:

*   **Backend Development:** Implementing each microservice (Node.js/Express), including API logic, database interactions, Kafka integration, and JWT authentication.
*   **Database Implementation:** Setting up the PostgreSQL database, applying the schema, enabling TimescaleDB, creating migrations, and seeding initial data.
*   **Frontend Development:** Building out the UI components for each page, implementing state management (Redux Toolkit), data fetching (React Query), form handling (Formik/Yup), data visualization (Recharts), and connecting to the backend APIs.
*   **DevOps:** Setting up Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana), logging (ELK), and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).
*   **Feature Implementation:** Developing the detailed logic for all features outlined in the requirements (Project Management, Work Orders, Financials, Quality Control, Reporting, Mobile capabilities).
*   **Testing:** Implementing comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
*   **Documentation:** Creating detailed API documentation, user guides, and training materials.

This initial setup provides a strong foundation for these subsequent development phases.
